    "> But throw 14 dice vs 12 dice in a Napoleonic Wars battle, and outcomes are possible that are 1/3^26, or about one in 10 trillion to 1 against. “But that won’t happen”, you’ll say. Sure, and nobody will win the lottery tomorrow. Oh right. Napoleon, Lannes, and 7 French armies evaporate; Charles with a 1-4 and 8 Austrians is untouched. \n",

All 6s are kills and all 5s are disrupts; if one side’s total of both exceeds the other by 3 or more it is a rout and all the 5s “promote” to 6s aka unit kills. Dice are given for SPs, leaders, and a national bonus (2 French, 1 other major powers, 0 minor powers), so number of dice thrown strictly exceeds number of forces present.\n",

    "> We all see exactly what that is *meant* to do - give an expectation of 15-20% losses in equal fights, but with 30-40% losses to the losers of outlier routs, that are to become more common as the odds rise. We understand the variance around that is expected to be limited 1-2 SD stuff.\n",

    "> But the 1 in 10 trillion outcomes being there moves us off that original design intention. If you do the math, the 100% wipeout of the superior French force in the example is about 0.2% or 1/500 to happen. There were a couple hundred major battles the in whole course of the Napoleonic wars (Napoleon was in 50 himself); the event described would be expected never to once in the course of them. \n",
